# Tracking My Coffee Brews – Game Changer! ☕

Lately, I've been getting more serious about my coffee—not just drinking it, but actually paying attention to how I make it. I realized that every time I brewed a cup, I was basically **winging it**: random grind sizes, whatever water temperature felt right, pouring however I felt that day.

> **The result?** Some cups were absolutely amazing, others... not so much. 😅

## The Lightbulb Moment 💡

So I decided to start keeping a **coffee brewing log** using a simple markdown template in [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). It's basically a structured form where I jot down all the details:

- ☕ Bean origin & roast date
- ⚖️ Grind size & brewing method
- 🌡️ Water temperature & timing
- 👅 Detailed tasting notes

Being able to see exactly what I did for each cup is where the magic happens.

## The Results Are In 📊

Now, instead of guessing, I can look back and say:

- _"Ah, this Ethiopian brew at 94°C with a medium-fine grind was **chef's kiss**"_
- _"Hmm, maybe that bloom time was too long"_

It's like having a **roadmap of my coffee journey**—each entry helps me fine-tune the next one.

### What I've Discovered:

✅ **My coffee has actually gotten better**  
✅ **I'm spotting patterns** in what works for certain beans  
✅ **Small tweaks** lead to huge flavor improvements  
✅ **It's genuinely fun** to see how my notes evolve over time

## Ready to Level Up Your Coffee Game? 🚀

If you're into coffee and want to step up your brewing game, I **highly recommend** starting a brew log. It turns every cup into a mini-experiment—and trust me, some of those experiments taste incredible.

Since I use Joplin as my note-taking app, I asked ChatGPT to create a markdown template that's been incredibly useful. Here's the complete template:
